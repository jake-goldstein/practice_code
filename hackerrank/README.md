This is where all of the hackerrank code that I have done (slash I have done a lot of it and want to re-do it so that) will live.

I think the format will be just like it is on hackerrank, even if that means some duplication. 

So there will be a few directories here, one for data structures, algorithms and so on.
In each of those there will be sub dirs for things like arrays or what not (not seperated by difficulty).
In each of those I'm thinking there will be a prompt, and a solution for all the problems that I have done, and perhaps for every language
