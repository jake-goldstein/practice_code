"Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in ARR."

Essentially, in a 6x 6 2D array:
                            A B C D E F 
                            G H I J K L
                            M N O P Q R
                            S T U V W X 
                            Y Z 1 2 3 4
                            5 6 7 8 9 0
                            
an hour glass is this shape: 
                             1 1 1
                               1
                             1 1 1
                             
Find the hourglass in the array that has the largest sum.


HINT 1: The largest number that can be used in an arry is 9, while the smallest is -9
HINT 2: There should be 16 hour glass sums in all of the arrays
