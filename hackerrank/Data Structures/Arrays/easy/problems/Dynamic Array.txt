This one is a bit confusing. 


Start with lastAnswer = 0.

You will get a list of lists and some number N which is a number of arrays to keep track of. 
Each list contains 3 items. 

Either:
1: 1 x y
2: 2 x y


Case 1:
Calculate the index of which array you want by doing this:

x (bitwise XOR) lastAnswer % N  

Then add y to the end of that array.


Case 2:
Calculate the index of which array you want by doing this:

x (bitwise XOR) lastAnswer % N  

Find y % size of the array that you are reffering to from the calc above.
The output of that calculation is now lastAnswer

You need to return a list of all of the last answers (not including the first one, the 0).
